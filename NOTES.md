## Notes
- Intent of this list is to act as Online bookmarks/lookup table for freely available online video courses. Focus would be to keep the list concise so that it is easy to browse. It would be easier to skim through 10 page list, find the course and start learning than having to read 50 pages of text. If you are student or from non-CS background, please try few courses to decide for yourself as to which course suits your learning curve best.
- 90% courses on Data Structures/Algorithms/Operating Systems/Machine Learning/Computer Networks/etc tend to have 80-90% overlap in curriculum. Descriptions for courses are helpful but adding descriptions/comments for each course can lead to repetition/subjective opinions. As a tradeoff, metadata like course number, name, prof, year, University/platform for Course is added in the URL itself. To access syllabus/notes/assignments, please visit link to the course or use Google search with course number/name. If a course has excellent notes/assignments/projects which cannot be reached through video's link, please feel free to add links alongside. 
- If available, please add following information to the link - &lt;Course-Number&gt; &lt;Course-Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt; &lt;Prof Name&gt; &lt;University Name/Platform&gt;. 
- If you are bored reading above 10 lines, imagine reading descriptions for hundreds of courses :)
- If You need assistance in deciding order in which courses should be taken, please refer to sample Course prerequsite charts by Universities to familiarize yourself with standard CS curriculum. If you need to know prerequisites for a particular course not covered by below samples, please check the course link or try Google.
