# Contribution Guidelines

- Recently the quality of MOOCs has diminished, therefore only MOOCs with comprehensive lecture material which cover a subject/topic in ample detail will be added. For example, MOOC on Computer Networks or Machine Learning with 4-5 hours may not be able to cover all topics in sufficient detail and thus should be avoided.
- One philosophy used in this list while integrating MOOCs is that links should directly point to videos for viewing/downloading than registration and waiting for the next session. If videos are directly accessible through the platform/youtube or any other source, please use the direct source. This is a list of video courses, not a list of MOOCs.
- Courses within a section are roughly sorted in terms of level i.e. undergraduate courses followed by upper-level undergraduate, followed by graduate courses. As courses are from multiple Universities, sorting is not perfect and only an approximation. For example, while adding a new undergraduate course on Algorithms, please feel free to add it along with other Algorithms courses than after graduate courses.
